Graph data
- Name
-attributes

Node data
- node labels
- node attributes

Edge data
- edge members
- edge attributes

What about temporal, multiplex, directed? can those characteristics be stored in the attributes?
checking of the format such that every edge member is in the node set

set defaults for temporal attributes etc.


Structure:

"hypergraph" : A set of attributes applying to the whole hypergraph
    "number-of-nodes" : Number of nodes in the hypergraph
    "number-of-hyperedges" : Number of hyperedges in the hypergraph
    "name" : name of the hypergraph dataset
    **attributes : Other attributes

"nodes" : The node labels as well as their associated attributes
    "node-labels" : A list of the node labels. All the nodes in the hyperedges should be present in this list
        **attributes : attributes of each node, default is empty

"hyperedges" : The hyperedges and their associated properties
    "hyperedge-list" : A list of the hyperedges
        **attributes : attributes of each hyperedge, default is empty
